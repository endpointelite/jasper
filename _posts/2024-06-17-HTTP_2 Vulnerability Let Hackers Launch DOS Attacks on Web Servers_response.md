## HTTP/2 Vulnerability Lets Hackers Launch DoS Attacks on Web Servers


## Introduction


The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. As the internet evolved, the need for a more efficient and secure protocol led to the development of HTTP/2, a major revision of the HTTP protocol. While HTTP/2 aimed to improve performance and security, recent research has uncovered a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against web servers.

## Historical Context


HTTP/1.1, the previous version of the protocol, had several limitations, including inefficient resource utilization, lack of prioritization, and performance issues, especially for modern web applications. To address these shortcomings, Google introduced the SPDY protocol in 2009, which later served as the basis for the development of HTTP/2.

In May 2015, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published the HTTP/2 specification (RFC 7540), which promised significant improvements in terms of performance, security, and efficiency. Major web browsers and servers quickly adopted the new protocol, and by the end of 2015, HTTP/2 was supported by most popular web browsers.

## Basic Concepts and Terminologies


HTTP/2

: A major revision of the HTTP protocol, designed to improve performance, security, and efficiency.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack

: A type of cyber attack that aims to make a system or network resource unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming it with excessive traffic or requests.

CONTINUATION Frame

: A type of frame in HTTP/2 used to continue a sequence of header block fragments when a single HEADERS frame is insufficient to carry the entire header block.

Header Block

: A collection of header fields in HTTP/2, encoded using the HPACK compression format.

HPACK

: A compression format used in HTTP/2 to reduce the overhead of transmitting HTTP headers.

## Technical Details


The vulnerability in question, dubbed "HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood," is a class of vulnerabilities found in various implementations of the HTTP/2 protocol. It allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that never sets the

END_HEADERS

```
END_HEADERS
```

flag, creating an infinite stream of headers that the HTTP/2 server must parse and store in memory.

## Attack Vector


The attack exploits the way HTTP/2 handles header blocks and CONTINUATION frames. When a single HEADERS frame is insufficient to store all the headers, the data stream continues with CONTINUATION frames until the

END_HEADERS

```
END_HEADERS
```

flag is set, signaling the end of the header block.

An attacker can initiate a new HTTP/2 stream against a vulnerable server and send HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames without setting the

END_HEADERS

```
END_HEADERS
```

flag. This creates a never-ending stream of headers that the server must process and store in memory, leading to resource exhaustion and potential server crashes.

## Affected Implementations


The vulnerability affects several popular HTTP/2 implementations, including:

Apache HTTP Server (CVE-2024-27316)

Apache Tomcat (CVE-2024-24549)

Apache Traffic Server (CVE-2024-31309)

Envoy Proxy (CVE-2024-27919, CVE-2024-30255)

Go (CVE-2023-45288)

nghttp2 (CVE-2024-28182)

Node.js (CVE-2024-27983)

Tempesta FW (CVE-2024-2758)

## Impact and Consequences


The impact of the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability varies depending on the affected implementation, but it can lead to the following consequences:

CPU Exhaustion: The server may become overwhelmed by the need to process the continuous stream of headers, leading to high CPU utilization and slowing down the server's response to legitimate requests.

## Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)


While there are no publicly available IOCs specific to the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability at the time of writing, security teams can monitor for the following potential indicators:

Unusually high CPU utilization or memory consumption on web servers.

Abnormal patterns in HTTP/2 traffic, such as a large number of CONTINUATION frames or streams without the

END_HEADERS

```
END_HEADERS
```

flag set.

Increased occurrences of HTTP error codes (e.g., 499 "Client Closed Request" or 502 "Bad Gateway") on web servers.

## Detection Rules


Security teams can implement detection rules in their Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to identify potential HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood attacks. These rules can be based on patterns or thresholds related to HTTP/2 traffic, server performance metrics, or known IOCs.

Example Snort rule:

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood Attempt"; flow:established; content:"|09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth:9; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 100, seconds 10; classtype:attempted-dos; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood Attempt"; flow:established; content:"|09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth:9; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 100, seconds 10; classtype:attempted-dos; sid:1000001; rev:1;)

```
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood Attempt"; flow:established; content:"|09 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00|"; depth:9; threshold:type both, track by_src, count 100, seconds 10; classtype:attempted-dos; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
```

This rule triggers an alert when more than 100 CONTINUATION frames (type 0x09) are observed within a 10-second window from a single source IP address, indicating a potential HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood attack attempt.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)


Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques can play a crucial role in detecting and mitigating the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability and other cybersecurity threats.

## Anomaly Detection

## Legal and Regulatory Implications


The exploitation of the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability and the resulting denial-of-service attacks can have significant legal and regulatory implications, particularly in the context of data breaches, privacy violations, and service disruptions.

## Data Breaches and Privacy Violations


While the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability itself does not directly lead to data breaches or privacy violations, successful denial-of-service attacks can potentially create opportunities for further exploitation or compromise of systems and data.

If an attacker can disrupt the availability of web servers or applications, they may be able to leverage other vulnerabilities or weaknesses to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or systems. This could potentially lead to data breaches and violations of privacy laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union or the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) in the United States.

## Service Disruptions and Contractual Obligations


Organizations that provide online services or operate critical infrastructure may have contractual obligations or service-level agreements (SLAs) that require them to maintain a certain level of availability and uptime. Successful exploitation of the HTTP/2 CONTINUATION Flood vulnerability, leading to service disruptions or outages, could potentially result in breaches of these contractual obligations.

Depending on the severity and duration of the service disruption, affected organizations may face legal consequences, such as financial penalties or lawsuits from customers or partners who have suffered losses due to the unavailability of services.

## Regulatory Actions and Penalties


In some cases, regulatory bodies may take action against organizations that fail to adequately protect their systems and data from cyber threats, including denial-of-service attacks. These actions can range from fines and penalties to more severe consequences, such as the revocation of licenses or operational permits.

For example, in the financial services industry, regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) may impose penalties or take enforcement actions against organizations that fail to maintain adequate cybersecurity measures, potentially leading to service disruptions or data breaches.

Similarly, in the healthcare sector, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States requires covered entities to implement appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI). Failure to do so could result in significant fines and penalties from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
